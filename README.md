Project to classify chat groups into relevant category


##PROJECT OVERVIEW

# Dataset: 20newgroups data from ucirvine repo

Business case / problem
Archiving newsgroup posts and news articles is a main use case in the news industry. We know that an article or a newsgroup post can also 
belong to more than one category. In this excercise, we will try to identify what topics an article may belong to using both supervised 
and unpservised techniques and will compare them based on key performance metrics.


Goal: 
1- LDA-based topic modeling - unsupervised training and inspect topics from that scheme
  - we'd want to understand if LDA would get close to the human-perceived topics
2- Supervised training using labeled data - look at the accuracy of that based on a test set and compare with LDA results
  - pick up random articles and test both LDA and 
3- apply the NLP concepts we learned in class such as data cleaning (stopwords etc), N-grams, word2vec
